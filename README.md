## Description:
<p id="description">This repository contains a implementation of various Random Number Generation (RNG) methods in C++, including MRG, ICG, KS test, LFG, and MSM. Each method serves a unique purpose in generating random numbers with different properties, catering to diverse application requirements.</p>
 
 


<h2> Methods Implemented:</h2>

*Multiple Recursive Generators (MRG): Utilizes multiple linear congruential generators in a recursive manner to produce pseudorandom numbers. This method is known for its simplicity and efficiency.

*Incremental Counter Generator (ICG): A method that generates random numbers by incrementing a counter value. It offers predictable sequences and is commonly used in applications requiring reproducibility.

*Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) Test: Implemented to assess the uniformity of generated random numbers. The KS test is a statistical method used to evaluate the goodness-of-fit between observed and expected distributions.

*Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFG): Employs linear feedback shift registers to generate pseudorandom sequences. LFGs are particularly useful in cryptography and simulation applications due to their long periods and good statistical properties.

*Marsaglia's Multiply-with-Carry (MSM): A type of linear congruential generator known for its high-quality random number sequences. MSMs offer excellent statistical properties and are widely used in Monte Carlo simulations and other numerical computations.
